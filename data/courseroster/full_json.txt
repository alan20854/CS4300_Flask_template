Retailing is not only a link in the supply chain, but also an important industry for a number of reasons. This industry, more than any other, is at the forefront of business changes since it directly connects with the consumer and generates demand for the rest of the economy. It is an intensely dynamic industry, with continuous changes in marketing channels, technology, and sourcing. It has gone through remarkable developments through history, and has often been an incubator for new business concepts. Currently, retailing is leading economic growth and transformation in emerging markets around the world, both through global sourcing and global marketing. In the US, retailing comprises 40% of the economy, and is the largest employer. Problems faced by retailers are shared by other firms in the economy, and retailers are often the dominant player in a supply chain. Thus, retailing is also academically interesting as a laboratory to learn and test concepts that may apply to other businesses. Various types of sophisticated data can be collected in retailing easier than in other industries. Performance can be measured accurately and rapidly. Managers in retailing can also change their strategies and product mix in relatively short periods of time.

First, there will be a lecture by the STEM faculty member on their research that is targeted to the freshmen audience and emphasizes the importance of work, its application, and the process of discovery and exploration that is intrinsic to the research. During the ~2 weeks following the lecture, students in the course will spend a one day shadowing graduate students and post-docs in the STEM faculty member's lab. Students will write a short description of what they saw and how it relates to the broader goals of the lab they learned about from the lecture. After all students have shadowed, there will be a second meeting that includes the students, and the scientists they shadowed, and the STEM faculty member. The focus of this second meeting will be discussing the experiments they saw, how they worked, how those measurements connect to the bigger picture goals for the laboratory and the project, as well as the nature of the relationships among the graduate students, post-docs, and faculty that enable this research. Finally, students will read and critically analyze a paper from the faculty member's lab, with a third and final meeting to discuss how this final scientific product relates to the people, experiments, and process of science they saw in the lab and discussed.

Projects range from online experiments to computer simulations to collection and analysis of data from social media. Students in this course bring a range of skills and experience to the lab, including coding, data analysis, modeling, and running experiments, and the research affords an opportunity to develop these skills further. In rare cases, students bring a project with them to the lab to work on for the semester. In most cases, however, students work in small teams as research assistants for ongoing research projects. In short, the course is an opportunity for \"interdependent study\" \u2014 a team version of the more familiar \"independent study.\" The research projects often lead to papers for submission to academic journals and/or conferences, but most projects are on-going and not completed during the semester. Students also occasionally develop a senior honors thesis from the research in the lab. Weekly meetings provide an opportunity for the projects featured that week to get feedback and suggestions from lab members. On occasion, we have collaborators from other universities Zoom/Skype in as well. Reading assignments are used to get background on a project and as part of the literature review that is needed to identify the project's particular contribution. However, most of a student's time will be spent actively participating in research, not just reading about previous studies. Students keep a weekly log of their activity that is submitted at the end of the semester.", "prerequisite": null, "offered": ["Spring"], "outcomes": null, "url": "https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/SP19/class/SOC/4390", "courseLength": null, "professor": ["Michael Macy"], "courseTitle": "Social Dynamics and Computational Methods", "courseNumber": "4390"}, {"subject": "SOC", "description": "Advanced discussion of topics in social and political philosophy.", "prerequisite": null, "offered": ["Spring"], "outcomes": null, "url": "https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/SP19/class/SOC/4430", "courseLength": null, "professor": ["Richard Miller"], "courseTitle": "Topics in Social and Political Philosophy", "courseNumber": "4430"}, {"subject": "SOC", "description": "Evaluation is a pervasive feature of contemporary life.
